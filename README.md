# Leather-Defect-Detection

**Description:**
A comparative study of CNN vs ViT architectures for the purpose of anomaly detection and defect classification in low-resolution leather surface images. 

### Models include:

* **EfficientNet-B0** - Model modified for required input and output tensors/dimensions.
* **Inception-V3** - Model modified for required input and output tensors/dimensions.
* **ResNet-50** - Model modified for required input and output tensors/dimensions.
* **Vision Transformer 01** - Dataset and preprocessing adapted to the leather dataset, original model structure adhered to.
* **Vision Transformer 02** - ViT Model structure modified for optimised results based on the same modified leather dataset.

### Datasets:

* **MVTec AD** - Small but high-res defect benchmark dataset with annotated ground truths (Leather module only)
* **Kaggle** - Low-resolution open-source Leather Defect Dataset
